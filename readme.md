### Rules of the game

A very popular card game in Japan. This game can be played by up to 15 people. It is most interesting when it is played by 6 to 10 people. The precedence of the cards is as follows: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, ace, 2, joker (if playing with jokers). We take a deck of cards, carefully shuffle, deal all the cards equally among all the players, dealing one card at a time. The first move is determined by lot. The first player puts his lowest card in value, if he has several low cards, then he discards them all. The right to the next move belongs to the next player clockwise. He must beat these cards with cards of higher value. The suit doesn't matter. If there are several cards, then it is necessary to cover the cards only with the same cards of the highest rank. Anyone who cannot cover these cards skips a turn. If none of the players have cards of the highest rank, then the cards are removed in the discard, in this case the move belongs to the player whose cards could not be covered. The game continues in a circle and the first player to discard all his cards wins. The strategy of the game is such that at the initial stage of the game it is necessary to protect the cards of greater value, since everyone is trying to fold small cards, and at the end of the game, large cards are needed. The most unlucky player who has cards left is called the poor man, and the one who got rid of his cards first is the rich man. After one game is played and the poor man and the rich man have been determined, the poor man must, before the start of the second game, when the cards are dealt, give his oldest card to the rich man. In response, the rich man gives his lowest card to the poor. The rich man starts the game. The game follows the same rules.
